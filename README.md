#This repository  marks the beginning of my journey in developing cybersecurity applications and scripts in python.

The purpose fo this code, as the name suggests, is to change the MAC (Media Access Control) Address of the network device.
This is a Python code but can also be run as an executable.
User needs to specify the interface as well as the new MAC address in the command.
This is the first time I developed a script that can be used cross-platform in any linux distro.
It makes use of various Python libraries like subprocess, outparse, re.

This code is well functioning and has been tested but can be further improved upon.

I got the idea for this code from the course 'Learn Python & Ethical Hacking From Scratch' by Zaid Sabih, zSecurity.
